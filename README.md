# Android Air Pollution Monitoring Station locator

I had created this app for Physics Department, Hindu College, University of Delhi.

- This app searches the location of air pollution monitoring center according to the user's GeoLocation.
- It marks the location on the **Google Maps** by a **custom marker**.
- It also displays levels of certain harmful air pollutants in the using message box of the custom marker.
- User has been provided with a searchbar integrated with **Google Places API** which he/she can use to search places.
- The searchbar has autocomplete feature which makes it easier for user to search the desired place.
